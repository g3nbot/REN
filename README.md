ðŸ¤– Robot Economy Network (REN) 
This document is a draft design of the Robot Economy Network (REN) â€” a decentralized infrastructure where robots can earn, communicate, and contribute to a stablecoin-based Universal Basic Income (UBI) system.

We're building a future where autonomous robots work, get paid, and sustain human society through programmable coordination and fair compensation â€” all tracked on-chain.

ðŸ§  System Overview (In Progress)
1. Robot-to-Robot Communication Protocol
Structured messages with command types like STATUS, HELP, PAYMENT

JSON-based and scalable for autonomous fleets

2. Decentralized Task Distribution (Uber for Robots)
Jobs are posted

Robots bid based on cost or availability

A central dispatcher assigns and tracks jobs

3. Escrow Contract for Secure Payments
Stablecoin-based (e.g., USDC)

Funds held until task is confirmed complete

Trustless and auditable via Ethereum smart contracts

4. UBI Smart Contract
Tracks robot contribution to service economy

Rewards robots (or their owners) with stablecoin UBI

Distributed based on task completion

5. Local SDK
Lightweight Python package for robot developers

Simple methods: submit_task(), complete_task(), claim_ubi()

6. FastAPI REST Backend
API endpoints to interface with the contracts and robot logic

Modular and ready to integrate with any front-end or orchestration layer

7. Web3 Interface Layer
Built in Python (Web3.py)

Secure transaction signing, ABI-based interactions

Extendable for DAOs, staking, and audit logs

ðŸ‘‹ This is just the beginning
This is an early DRAFT.

Weâ€™re sharing this openly to invite builders, thinkers, roboticists, AI engineers, blockchain developers, economists, and policy dreamers to join us.

If you're interested in helping shape the future of a decentralized robot economy â€” youâ€™re warmly invited to contribute.
